    "text": "My family and I started the process of moving from Gilbert AZ. to Hawaii for a job related opportunity. I cannot begin to explain the stress I was enduring with the thought of trying to sell my house while living out of state let alone several hours across the ocean. I contacted Rick to work the short sale of my house. While I was still in my house stressing at trying to sell everything I possibly could in a short amount of time so I could move. Rick quickly formulated a plan to have an immediate open house. Rick took lots of pictures of my home and quickly got the word out about this property. Rick’s plan worked excellent as he was able to get 24 couples to view the home in one afternoon instead of a couple at a time over the next several weeks. Two days later after the open house Rick had 14 offers in hand. What a relief it was for me knowing this part of the process of selling a house was completed with minimal interruptions of my time on what I was trying to accomplish. While in Hawaii, Rick kept me abreast of status of the offer that was accepted. In really no time at all I was signing documents on the sale of my house. Rick’s plan was short, sweet and effective. I cannot explain how satisfied I was with Rick through the short time it took to sell my house. I personally recommend Rick to anybody thinking of selling or buying a house. Rick is a seasoned veteran and is an expert at his profession.",

Rick interviewed several Realtors in our new area and referred us to exactly the Realtor we needed. Thank you Rick!"

    "text": "Mr. Rumack represented me in the recent sale of a home in gilbert. Although I live in Tucson, making this a long distance transaction, the entire process was handed with the utmost efficiency. There were multiple offers with a wide variety of terms and conditions. The spread sheet he provided made it possible to conveniently compare all of them. Most impressively, Mr. Rumack kept in constant telephone and e-mail contact with updates and progress reports throughout the entire process leading to a usccessful closing. I am happy to recommend him to anyone wishing for results and a positive outcome."
