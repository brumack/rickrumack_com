						Originally from the San Diego area, I graduated from UCLA in Los Angeles, California. My wife
						and I have lived in the Southeast Valley since 2005 are raising our two children here. I've
						spent 10 years in the high tech industry working for Intel and Lockheed Martin. While at
						Lockheed, I spent 3 years in their sales organization, receiving extensive training in both
						sales and negotiation.
						<br /><br />

						I have been a real estate investor in the valley since 2008 focusing on single family homes. I
						am a member of the Arizona Real Estate Investors Association and the Phoenix Real Estate Club,
						as well as being a member of the National, Arizona and Southeast Valley Associations of
						Realtors.
						<br /><br />
						There are many qualities and skills that go into being an excellent real estate professional -
						integrity, in-depth community and market knowledge, marketing savvy, effective negotiation
						skills and a high-quality professional network, all of which are hallmarks of how I work. That
						said, in my experience as a East Valley real estate professional, I've also found that providing
						the very best service is essentially about putting my clients first. This means keeping myself
						accessible, being a good listener as well as a good communicator, and responding quickly to your
						needs. This "client first" philosophy has always been my approach and it requires me to
						continually improve my skills and ways of doing business. In addition, I've found that the
						latest technologies are enabling me to do everything I've always done, only much more quickly
						and efficiently. They've also helped me to extend the range of services I provide to my clients.
						So when you decide that you'd like to buy or sell a home in the Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa, Queen
						Creek, Scottsdale or Tempe areas, please contact me.
